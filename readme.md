This is a chat window app. It allows for multiple people to communicate with each other when the server is set up.

To run this, after downloading it, move the folder to an appropiate location. Then, from the command line, locate the directory of the folder. Use "node server.js" to launch a local server to run the app.
From there, just type "localhost:3000" into your browser, and the app should open. From there's the app is pretty self-explantory. To reset the app, close the server side (CMD/CTRL+C) and run it again from the command line.
